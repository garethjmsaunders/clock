# Clock

## Description

I like to have a large digital clock on my Windows desktop. However, I am unable to run any kind of widget (Windows 8 Gadgets, Rainmeter, etc.) on my work laptop, but I can open web pages in a browser.

So, I downloaded this Full Screen Clock (24-hour) code from [Project Nayuki](https://www.nayuki.io/page/full-screen-clock-javascript) with permission, as the Project Nayuki website advises:

> Warning: Do not hotlink to the clock HTML files at [www.nayuki.io](https://www.nayuki.io/). Please download them for your local use. Abusers will be dealt with.

and adapted it for my own personal use. It is styled on the Desktop Clock gadget for Windows 8.

On my work laptop, I run it in Microsoft Edge without the browser chrome by going to Apps > Install this site as an app and pinning the shortcut to my taskbar and running it automatically at log in.
