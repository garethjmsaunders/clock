## Description

I like to have a large digital clock on my Windows desktop. However, I am unable to run any kind of widget (Windows 8 Gadgets, Rainmeter, etc.) on my work laptop. But I can open web pages in a browser.

So, I downloaded this full screen clock code from the Project Nayuki website, with permission as the Project Nayuki website advises:

> Warning: Do not hotlink to the clock HTML files at [www.nayuki.io](https://www.nayuki.io/). Please download them for your local use. Abusers will be dealt with.

I have not changed the original time script, I have added the current date and changed the font.

I run this in Microsoft Edge as an app, autostarting when Windows boots up.
